# Pygame-yum
This is a clone of the famous 5 dice game of Yum.

Tested on python 3.6 / Windows 8.1

Couple addons could make it nicer, namely:

--> Saving high scores

--> Pausing / option to start a new game

--> Each dice having a "rolling" animation

--> Using a dictionary data structure for both the dices and the scoring fields ('dices' and 'FIELDS' variables respectively)

--> Prettier GUI


To use:

Install pygame

Open a command prompt

cd {the directory where yum.py is located}

python3 yum.py
